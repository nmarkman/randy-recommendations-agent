- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities as needed

#### Example: Randy in ~20 lines of code
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def get_restaurant_recommendation(location: str) -> str:
    # Google Places API call here
    return "Cozy Thai spot downtown with great reviews!"

@function_tool
def send_email(message: str) -> str:
    # Gmail SMTP here
    return "Email sent successfully!"

randy = Agent(
    name="Randy",
    instructions="You're a friendly recommendation agent. Pick a random activity type, get a recommendation, and email it with enthusiasm!",
    tools=[get_restaurant_recommendation, send_email]
)

# That's it! Randy can now make recommendations and send emails
result = Runner.run_sync(randy, "Time for a weekly recommendation!")
```
